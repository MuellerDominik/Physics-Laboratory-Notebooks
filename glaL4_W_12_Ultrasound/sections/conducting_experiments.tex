To measure the ultrasound velocity in water, a water bath and a reflector were used. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:experimental_arrangement_water_bath}:

The measuring objects are a range of different materials (PMMA, aluminium, copper, brass, water). The following figure \ref{fig:measurement_objects} shows the PMMA object, and the metal cylinders:

\subsection{Measuring Procedure}
\label{subsec:measuring_procedure}
The oscilloscope is connected to the ultrasonic pulser / receiver unit and shows the attenuated echoes received by the piezoelectric transducer. The time of flight (the duration it takes the sound wave to travel through the medium and return back to the transducer) is measured with the vertical cursors. Similarly, the amplitude is measured with the horizontal cursors. Figure \ref{fig:measuring_procedure} shows the waveform measured on the oscilloscope with a 5 MHz transducer in PMMA.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{measuring_procedure}
	\caption{Annotated picture of the waveform shown on the oscilloscope. The time of flight $\Delta t$ and the amplitude $A$ are marked in red. The peaks are the echoes that occur when the wave is totally reflected. The initial small peak is likely a reflection on the bottom plate of the piezoelectric transducer.}
