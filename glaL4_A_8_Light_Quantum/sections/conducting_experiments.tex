\subsection{Measurements}
\label{subsec:Measurements}
In this experiment, the following measurements were conducted (exact descriptions of the tasks can be found in the assignment \cite{light_quantum}):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Photoelectric effect: Direct measurement
	\item Photoelectric effect: Counter-field method
	\item Light-emitting diode: Threshold voltage $U$ and peak wave length $\lambda$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experimental Arrangement}
\label{subsec:experimental_arrangement}
The experiment was arranged as shown below in figure \ref{fig:experimental_arrangement}:

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{experimental_arrangement_photoeffect_picture}
	\caption{Annotated picture of the experimental arrangement for measurements no. 1 and 2: The photoelectric effect was measured directly and with the counter-field method. The mercury-vapor lamp was running for at least 10 min before any measurements were conducted.}

\end{figure}

\newpage
To measure the voltage $U$ and the peak wave length $\lambda$ an oscilloscope and a spectrometer were used. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:experimental_arrangement_led_picture}:

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{experimental_arrangement_led_picture}
	\caption{Annotated picture of the experimental arrangement for measurement no. 3: The threshold voltage $U$ and the peak wave length $\lambda$ was measured with an oscilloscope and a spectrometer respectively. The function generator was used to power the LEDs. The oscilloscope was configured in the XY time mode to measure the current in function of the voltage.}

\subsection{Measurement Objects}
\label{subsec:measurement_objects}
The measurement objects are a mercury-vapor lamp and several different LEDs.

\paragraph{Mercury-Vapor Lamp}
Figure \ref{fig:hg} shows the spectrum of a mercury-vapor lamp which was measured.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hg}
	\caption{The left picture shows the spectrum of a mercury-vapor lamp. A dispersive prism was used to disperse the light of the lamp. The right picture shows the line spectrum of a mercury-vapor lamp with the most important peaks annotated \cite{mercury-vapor_lamp_picture}. - partially modified}
	\label{fig:hg}
\end{figure}

The photoelectric voltage was measured at the following wave lengths shown in table \ref{tab:hg_colors}:

\begin{table}[H]

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{This table lists the wave length and their respective color.}

\end{table}

$^{1)}$ To measure the photoelectric voltage at a wavelength of 546.1 nm the filter OG530 was used.
$^{2)}$ To measure the photoelectric voltage at a wavelength of 578.2 nm the filter OG570 was used.
